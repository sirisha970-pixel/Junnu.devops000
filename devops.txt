DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between software development and IT operations teams. It aims to automate and streamline the entire software development lifecycle, from development and testing to deployment and operations. By breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared responsibility, DevOps enables faster, more reliable software delivery and improved business outcomes.
